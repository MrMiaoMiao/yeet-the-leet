#
# Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all
# nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
# 
# The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
# Output: 32
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
# Output: 23
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
# The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
# 
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rangeSumBST(self, root: TreeNode, L: int, R: int) -> int:
