#
# 
# Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the
# top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver
# Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
# Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so
# they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". For the left two
# athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their
# scores.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
# All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
