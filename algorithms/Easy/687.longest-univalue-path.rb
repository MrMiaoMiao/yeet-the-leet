# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in
# the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 
# The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
# between them.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# 
# 
# ⁠             5
# ⁠            / \
# ⁠           4   5
# ⁠          / \   \
# ⁠         1   1   5
# 
# 
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
# 
# 
# ⁠             1
# ⁠            / \
# ⁠           4   5
# ⁠          / \   \
# ⁠         4   4   5
