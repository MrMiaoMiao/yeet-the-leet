#
# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
# 
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
# node down to the farthest leaf node.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
# 
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# return its depth = 3.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Integer}
