# Testcase Example:  '[-10,-3,0,5,9]'
#
# Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a
# height balanced BST.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
# in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more
# than 1.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
# 
# One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following
# height balanced BST:
# 
# ⁠     0
# ⁠    / \
# ⁠  -3   9
# ⁠  /   /
# ⁠-10  5
#

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {TreeNode}
