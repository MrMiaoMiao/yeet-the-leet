#
# Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum
# absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠  1
# ⁠   \
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   /
# ⁠  2
# 
# Output:
# 1
# 
# Explanation:
# The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1
# (or between 2 and 3).
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# There are at least two nodes in this BST.
# This question is the same as 783:

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
# end
# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Integer}
def get_minimum_difference(root)
