#
# Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the
# result has only one digit.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 38
# Output: 2 
# Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
# Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
#
# @param {Integer} num
# @return {Integer}
