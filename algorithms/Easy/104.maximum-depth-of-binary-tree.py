#
# Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
# 
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
# node down to the farthest leaf node.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
# 
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# return its depth = 3.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
