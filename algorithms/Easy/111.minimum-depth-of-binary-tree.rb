#
# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
# 
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the
# root node down to the nearest leaf node.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
# 
# 
# ⁠   3
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9  20
# ⁠   /  \
# ⁠  15   7
# 
# return its minimum depth = 2.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
#     end
