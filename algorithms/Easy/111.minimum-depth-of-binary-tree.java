 *
 * Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
 * 
 * The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the
 * root node down to the nearest leaf node.
 * 
 * Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠   3
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 9  20
 * ⁠   /  \
 * ⁠  15   7
 * 
 * return its minimum depth = 2.
