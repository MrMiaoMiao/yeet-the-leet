#
# You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing heads
# when tossed.
# 
# Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target if
# you toss every coin exactly once.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
# Output: 0.40000
# Example 2:
# Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
# Output: 0.03125
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= prob.length <= 1000
# 0 <= prob[i] <= 1
# 0 <= target <= prob.length
# Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct
# answer.

# @param {Float[]} prob
# @param {Integer} target
