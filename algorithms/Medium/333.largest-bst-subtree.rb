#
# Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree
# (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.
# 
# Note:
# A subtree must include all of its descendants.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
# 
# ⁠  10 
# ⁠  / \ 
# ⁠ 5  15 
# ⁠/ \   \ 
# 1   8   7
# 
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
# ⁠            The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
