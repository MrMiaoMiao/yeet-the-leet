#
# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence
# path.
# 
# The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node
# in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path
# need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠  1
# ⁠   \
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   / \
# ⁠  2   4
# ⁠       \
# ⁠        5
# 
# Output: 3
# 
# Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# 
# ⁠  2
# ⁠   \
# ⁠    3
# ⁠   / 
# ⁠  2    
# ⁠ / 
# ⁠1
# 
# Output: 2 
# 
# Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.
