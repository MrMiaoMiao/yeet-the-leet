#
# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
# 
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where
# "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# board =
# [
# ⁠ ['A','B','C','E'],
# ⁠ ['S','F','C','S'],
# ⁠ ['A','D','E','E']
# ]
# 
# Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
# Given word = "SEE", return true.
# Given word = "ABCB", return false.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
# 1 <= board.length <= 200
# 1 <= board[i].length <= 200
# 1 <= word.length <= 10^3
# 
# 
#
# @param {Character[][]} board
# @param {String} word
# @return {Boolean}
def exist(board, word)
