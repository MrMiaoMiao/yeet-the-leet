# Testcase Example:  '["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]'
#
# Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter,
# for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the
# sequence:
# 
# 
# "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
# 
# Given a list of non-empty strings which contains only lowercase alphabets,
# group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
# Output: 
# [
# ⁠ ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
# ⁠ ["az","ba"],
# ⁠ ["acef"],
# ⁠ ["a","z"]
# ]
# 
# 
#
# @param {String[]} strings
# @return {String[][]}
