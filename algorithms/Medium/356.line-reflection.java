 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1],[-1,1]]'
 *
 * Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to
 * y-axis that reflect the given points symmetrically, in other words, answer
 * whether or not if there exists a line that after reflecting all points over
 * the given line the set of the original points is the same that the reflected
 * ones.
 * 
 * Note that there can be repeated points.
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do better than O(n^2) ?
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,1],[-1,1]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can choose the line x = 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: We can't choose a line.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == points.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * -10^8 <= points[i][j] <= 10^8
