#
# Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a
# longest path in that tree.
# 
# The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [u, v] is a
# bidirectional edge between nodes u and v.  Each node has labels in the set
# {0, 1, ..., edges.length}.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# A longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 
# A longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= edges.length < 10^4
# edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
# 0 <= edges[i][j] <= edges.length
# The given edges form an undirected tree.
# 
# 
#
# @param {Integer[][]} edges
# @return {Integer}
