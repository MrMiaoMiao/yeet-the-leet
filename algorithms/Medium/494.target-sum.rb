# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,1,1]\n3'
#
# You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target,
# S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one
# from + and - as its new symbol.
# 
# Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to
# target S.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# 
# -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
# +1+1+1+1-1 = 3
# 
# There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
# The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
# Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.
# 
# 
#
# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} s
# @return {Integer}
