#
# A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2
# children.
# 
# Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element
# of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
# 
# Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
# 
# You may return the final list of trees in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 7
# Output:
# [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def allPossibleFBT(self, N: int) -> List[TreeNode]:
