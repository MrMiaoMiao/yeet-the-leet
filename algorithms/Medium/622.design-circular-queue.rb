#
# Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a
# linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO
# (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the
# first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
# 
# One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the
# spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full,
# we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the
# queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new
# values.
# 
# Your implementation should support following operations:
# 
# 
# MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
# Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return
# -1.
# Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
# enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the
# operation is successful.
# deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the
# operation is successful.
# isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
# isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be
# 3
# circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
# circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
# circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
# circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
# circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
# circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
# circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
# circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
# circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# All values will be in the range of [0, 1000].
# The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 1000].
# Please do not use the built-in Queue library.
# 
#
