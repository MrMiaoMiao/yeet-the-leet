#
# A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2
# children.
# 
# Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element
# of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
# 
# Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
# 
# You may return the final list of trees in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 7
# Output:
# [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
