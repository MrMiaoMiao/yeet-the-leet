# Testcase Example:  '1'
#
# Given the API rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1
# to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the
# range 1 to 10. You can only call the API rand7 and you shouldn't call any
# other API. Please don't use the system's Math.random().
# 
# 
# Notice that Each test case has one argument n, the number of times that your
# implemented function rand10 will be called while testing. 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# What is the expected value for the number of calls to rand7() function?
# Could you minimize the number of calls to rand7()?
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: [2]
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 2
# Output: [2,8]
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: [3,8,10]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 
# 
#
# The rand7() API is already defined for you.
# def rand7()
# @return {Integer} a random integer in the range 1 to 7
