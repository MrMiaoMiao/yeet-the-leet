#
# Given a node in a binary search tree, find the in-order successor of that
# node in the BST.
# 
# If that node has no in-order successor, return null.
# 
# The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than
# node.val.
# 
# You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each
# node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for
# Node:
# 
# 
# class Node {
# ⁠   public int val;
# ⁠   public Node left;
# ⁠   public Node right;
# ⁠   public Node parent;
# }
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you solve it without looking up any of the node's values?
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node and
# the return value is of Node type.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
# Output: null
# Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the
# answer is null.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: tree =
# [15,6,18,3,7,17,20,2,4,null,13,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,9],
# node = 15
# Output: 17
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: tree =
# [15,6,18,3,7,17,20,2,4,null,13,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,9],
# node = 13
# Output: 15
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: tree = [0], node = 0
# Output: null
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
# 1 <= Number of Nodes <= 10^4
# All Nodes will have unique values.
# 
#
