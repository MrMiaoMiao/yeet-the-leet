# 
# Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this
# array is defined as follow:
# 
# The root is the maximum number in the array. 
# The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray
# divided by the maximum number.
# The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray
# divided by the maximum number. 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of
# this tree.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
# Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:
# 
# ⁠     6
# ⁠   /   \
# ⁠  3     5
# ⁠   \    / 
# ⁠    2  0   
# ⁠      \
# ⁠       1
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].
#

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode

#     def initialize(val = 0, left = nil, right = nil)
#         @val = val
#         @left = left
#         @right = right
