# Testcase Example:  '"eceba"\n2'
#
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at
# most k distinct characters.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "aa", k = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
# 
# 
# 
#
# @param {String} s
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Integer}
