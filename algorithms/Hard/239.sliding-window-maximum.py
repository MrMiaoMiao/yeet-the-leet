#
# Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from
# the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers
# in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
# Return the max sliding window.
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it in linear time?
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
# Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
# Explanation: 
# 
# Window position                Max
# ---------------               -----
# [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
# ⁠1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
# ⁠1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
# ⁠1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
# ⁠1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
# ⁠1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# 1 <= k <= nums.length
# 
#

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
