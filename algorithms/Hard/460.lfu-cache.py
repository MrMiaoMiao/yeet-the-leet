#
# Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
# It should support the following operations: get and put.
# 
# get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key
# exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
# put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
# When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least
# frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this
# problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same
# frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.
# 
# Note that the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to the
# get and put functions for that item since it was inserted. This number is set
# to zero when the item is removed.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );
# 
# cache.put(1, 1);
# cache.put(2, 2);
# cache.get(1);       // returns 1
# cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
# cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
# cache.get(3);       // returns 3.
# cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.
# cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
# cache.get(3);       // returns 3
# cache.get(4);       // returns 4
